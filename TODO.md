# TODOs

## File Uploads
- Display the contents of the upload-channel on a sub-site
- Avatars should also be manageable with the FT-commands (Someone on the forum said use cid=0 (or 1?) for avatars)

## Docker Deployment
- Add the functionality to deploy `tsviewer` in a docker container
- Add the Flask Webserver Port to the configuration
- This also means we have to use a production WSGI server within the container (unicorn?)

## Admin Page (Requires: Login)
- Build UI for all the troll commands
- Display client detail information

## Talk to designer
